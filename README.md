# University of Pittsburgh TELCOM 2310

This repository contains materials for the TELCOM 2310 labs.

## Environment Setup

Labs will use the [Fabric testbed](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/).

To set up your Fabric environment, see the instructions here: [Fabric
Setup](https://github.com/amybabay/telcom2310/Fabric_Setup.md).

## Lab Materials

Lab materials are in the [labs](https://github.com/amybabay/telcom2310/labs)
directory.

Each lab will typically include two Jupyter notebooks, as well as a worksheet
for you to fill out. The two notebooks are:
    - **CreateSlice.ipynb**: Creates the Fabric slice/topology needed for the lab
    - **LabName.ipynb**: Performs any additional configuration on slice nodes (uploading files, installing packages, configuring network interfaces) and provides instructions for running the lab

## Acknowledgment and additional resources

Setup instructions and Lab 3 are adapted from tutorials provided by the Fabric
project:
