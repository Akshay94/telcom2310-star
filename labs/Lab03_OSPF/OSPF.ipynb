    "In this lab you will experiment with the OSPF routing protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSPF stands for Open-Shortest-Path-First. OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol which means it can automatically react to unexpected connectivity changes in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each OSPF router maintains a Link State Database (LSDB) containing Link State Advertisements (LSAs). \n",
    "\n",
    "OSPF routers use Hello messages to discover their neighbors, and determine when links break. By default (and in our example network) OSPF routers send Hello packets every 10 seconds on point to point segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newly discovered neighbors exchange their LSDBs with Database Description messages (DDs). OSPF routers then fill in the gaps in their databases using a three-way handshake consisting of a Link-State Request (LSR), Link-State Update (LSU), and finally a Link-State Acknowledgement (LSAck). \n",
    "OSPF employs a configurable Router Dead Interval, which is the maximum time after which a \"silent\" router (one that hasn't sent a Hello) is declared \"down\". \n",
    "\n",
    "OSPF uses Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm to compute routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "OSPF allows for hierarchical routing using areas, but to keep things simple, for this module all routers are configured in the same area (area zero). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about OSPF and working with FRR’s implementation of it here: https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/ospfd.html "

    "\n",
    "1. Traceroute is a tool for determining the route packets takes through the network from one node to another. On **node A's SSH Terminal**, trace the route from A to C's 10.1.3.1 interface by typing:\n",

    "    traceroute 10.1.3.1\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    traceroute to 10.1.3.1 (10.1.3.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n",
    "     1  10.1.4.1 (10.1.4.1)  0.058 ms  0.048 ms  0.043 ms\n",
    "     2  10.1.3.1 (10.1.3.1)  0.117 ms  0.112 ms  0.125 ms\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This shows that a packet leaving A and heading to C will travel first to 10.1.4.1 (on node D), and then to 10.1.3.1 (on node C). This shows the route is going from A through D to C.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As before, take down one of node D's interfaces. On **node D's SSH Terminal** take down the interface corresponding to the 10.1.4.1 address using the same following command: \n",
    "```\n",
    "ip link set dev <interface> down\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Re-run the traceroute on node A's SSH Terminal by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "traceroute 10.1.3.1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Packets should be automatically rerouted through Node B. Can you tell that this is happening? How? **Answer and copy and paste your output in Lab03_Worksheet.docx**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Back on **node D's SSH Terminal**, bring the interface back up by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ip link set dev <interface> up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

First, type `config` to enter the general configuration mode, then type `interface <interface>` (with `<interface>` replaced by the name of the interface you want to modify, enp7s0 or enp8s0) to enter the interface-specific configuration. Then, you can use the command `ip ospf cost <cost>` (with `<cost>` replaced by the cost you want to set for the interface) to modify the cost. Then type `exit` twice to exit the configuration modes.
